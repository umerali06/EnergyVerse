# FEV Decision Log

## Resolved Decisions

| ID | Decision | Chosen Option | Status | Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-001 | Backend framework | **FastAPI (Python 3.11+)** | **RESOLVED — LOCKED** | 2026-07-15 |
| D-002 | Primary database and AI vector storage | **Firebase Firestore** (server-side only via FastAPI + Admin SDK) | **RESOLVED — LOCKED** | 2026-07-15 |
| D-003 | Authentication provider | **Firebase Authentication** (email/password + verification + reset) | **RESOLVED — LOCKED** | 2026-07-15 |

## Decision Details

### D-001 — Backend Framework → FastAPI (Python 3.11+)

- **Decision owner:** Product owner
- **Chosen option:** FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
- **Context and rationale:** FastAPI is the ONLY tier that touches the database, via the Firebase Admin SDK. No direct client access to Firestore.
- **Alternatives considered:** NestJS (Node.js)
- **Consequences:** All backend development in Python; Poetry for dependency management; ruff + mypy for linting/type-checking.

### D-002 — Database → Firebase Firestore

- **Decision owner:** Product owner
- **Chosen option:** Firebase Firestore, accessed server-side only through FastAPI
- **Context and rationale:** Firestore Security Rules locked to server-only. No separate vector store for MVP (revisit only if AI embeddings need it later). No direct client access.
- **Alternatives considered:** PostgreSQL (explicitly ruled out per source brief)
- **Consequences:** Data modeling uses Firestore collections/documents; tenant isolation via `company_id` on every record; offline sync handled at the app layer with server reconciliation.

### D-003 — Authentication → Firebase Authentication

- **Decision owner:** Product owner
- **Chosen option:** Firebase Authentication (email/password + verification + reset)
- **Context and rationale:** `role` + `company_id` stored in custom claims. FastAPI verifies the Firebase ID token via the Admin SDK. Provider-agnostic seam preserved so enterprise SSO/SAML/OIDC slots in later.
- **Alternatives considered:** Custom authentication
- **Consequences:** Token verification in FastAPI middleware; custom claims for RBAC; abstraction layer for future SSO integration.

## Locked Principles

These principles are reaffirmed alongside the resolved decisions and apply to all phases:

1. **Multi-tenancy:** Every record scoped by `company_id`. No cross-tenant data leakage.
2. **RBAC:** Many-to-many role→permission mapping enforced in BOTH FastAPI and UI. No hardcoded role enums.
3. **AI is advisory:** Inspector must confirm/override before any report finalizes. AI never takes autonomous action on safety-critical data.
4. **Offline-first field flows:** Durable local queues with background sync and conflict resolution.
5. **Audit-log every critical action:** All mutations to safety-critical data are logged with actor, timestamp, and before/after state.

## Session Review

- **2026-07-15 — Phase 0.3:** D-001 through D-003 remain locked. The Firebase Admin SDK/Firestore health implementation conforms to those decisions; no new product decision was introduced.
